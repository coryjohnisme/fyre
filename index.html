                        <p>Of course! If you provide brand guidelines, we will stick to them. If you just want us to
                            look at your website or past work, we can do that too. Just let us know when you submit a
                            job.</p>

                        <p>Yes and no. We work more like a lone wolf. We will follow the requests of the submission,
                            without further direct collaboration. However, project files can be delivered for your
                            designer to continue work on. Also, if you have a project you’ve done in the past or that
                            needs to be changed or completed, and you can provide the project files, we can usually
                            accommodate.</p>
